Cloned repo directly from Sam's GitHub using the URL in my terminal
    >  git clone https://github.com/Sam-Fishwick/MyFirstRepo

Created Log using vim
    >  vim Luke\'s\ Log

Updated Log then committed
    >  git add .
    >  git status
    >  git commit -m "Created Lukes Log"

Attempted to push, met with authentication error because I cloned from Sam's GitHub
    > git push
    remote: Invalid username or password.
    fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/Sam-Fishwick/MyFirstRepo/'

Learned that I have to Fork the repo to my GitHub, then clone that version
I forked using the website, and cloned using my terminal
    >  git clone https://github.com/LucasFishwicas/MyFirstRepo

Repeated process of creating Luke's Log.
